    <p>levelZero is the starting point of this boot camp for programming. It is:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>A beginner-friendly, structured course to provide you basics of programming: A free and open level, basically designed for all beginners, people who have never written a single line of code.</li>
                <li>An enabler for everyone: The levelZero is an enabler for beginners to learn programming and compete with other intermediates at the same level for the levelOne.</li>
                <li>A free-of-cost decider for you: It will provide you with a free-of-cost, fun project-based training, where you can dabble your feet in programming, have fun and decide if you like it or not.</li>
                <li>A filter for levelOne: You know by now that levelOne will be a small focused group of dedicated learners who wish to enhance their knowledge and maybe wish to get a (better) job. Hence, levelZero will teach you the basics with fun projects, and then with those projects, you can apply for levelOne.</li>
                <li>A short and smart way to create from zero and learn: levelZero will have very short easy lessons where you will create your own 10+ projects. While enjoying the process, you will gain basic knowledge about HTML, JavaScript, Web Development, and React.</li>
                <li>Training where you create useful apps to share with everyone online: We believe that if you learn, create, and share it with your friends or family or social circle and people see, use and appreciate it, it makes you a better developer because it motivates you to create more projects or stuff which end users use. So we will create some useful fun apps together. All of it will be hosted online and you can share it with your friends, family, and everyone to let them know that you have embarked on your programming journey.</li>
                <li>A place where the money is not the first criteria anymore: The levelOne will serve as a better filter around all the programmers (including the 100k students around social media platforms of Tanay) as the fees for levelOne will be secondary and your will is the primary. levelOne, the ticket to your grand future, wonâ€™t be open for anyone or everyone who can pay the fees or pay it faster. It should be and will be, decided on who has worked harder to get to levelOne.</li>
                <li>A platform to distinguish you: Once you create your apps and complete your assignments and share and showcase your projects, it will distinguish you from anyone who just throws money at a problem. It will make you the in-charge and will give you as well as us the confidence that you will be there in the six-month journey with us and you will work hard as a serious person and you mean business.</li>
