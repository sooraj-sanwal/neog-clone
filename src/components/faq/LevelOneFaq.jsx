                <li>An intermediate level, structured course: It is a six-month boot camp for hard-working programmers of intermediate level (that you become after completing levelZero).
                    <ul>
                        <li>A closed level with dedicated students: levelOne is only open for the qualifiers. The Live classes on Zoom/Teams will be conducted for the selected students only. This dedicated peer group will enrich your learnings through discussion and reflection, help you through your doubts and become your friends.</li>
                        <li>To teach the industry level coding: Every session for 6 months is drawn in a job-oriented way to increase your overall value as a programmer, train you on the market needs, get you prepared for job interviews</li>
                        <li>A six-month live coding course: Specially designed for advanced level job-oriented programming.
                        </li>
                        <li>Project-based learning: Throughout this journey, you will create your 10-apps with us and showcase your learnings. We believe that if you learn, create, and share it with your friends or family or social circle and people see, use and appreciate it, it makes you a better developer because it motivates you to create more projects or stuff that end users use. So we will create some useful apps together and host everything online to share and prepare an excellent portfolio of yours.</li>
                        <li>A fun classroom experience course: After a survey, we realized that one of the main reasons you do not complete your online courses as compared to colleges is the lack of fun and a sense of belonging. levelOne is limited to provide you with the experience of studying with your classmates while having fun, discussions, and making friends. Importantly, this will help you to complete the six-month course with your friends and get a job.</li>
                        <li>A small group to bring in industry experts: The levelOne group can discuss among themselves their problems and questions. Further, Tanay and other industry experts will hang out with the levelOne for fruitful discussions.</li>
                        <li>A level that gets you a job: Once you get into levelOne, you wonâ€™t only learn the job-oriented programming tools and get interview training. But we will get you ready for jobs and hopefully, get you placed with the help of our partner, roc8.careers.</li>
                        <p>Please note that we will arrange interviews for you and we will equip and train you enough to crack those interviews. But in the end, it is you and your performance that will matter. Hence, we would like to reiterate that we DO NOT GUARANTEE any job or placement.</p>
